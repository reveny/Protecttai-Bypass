# Protecttai-Bypass
A xposed module to bypass protectt.ai in Kotak Neo

## Overview

This repository contains a simple demonstration of how to bypass the Protectt.ai security solution implemented in the Kotak Neo app. Protectt.ai is designed to protect Android applications from various security threats, but it has significant flaws that make it unreliable and easy to bypass.

## Why Protectt.ai is Problematic

- **High Rate of False Positives**: Protectt.ai flags unrooted devices with their flawed LSPosed detection done by checking props.

- **Easily Bypassed**: Protectt.ai can be bypassed with minimal effort.

## Why?
This repository demonstrates a method to bypass Protectt.ai's protection with a single hook, highlighting the problems of this security solution. 
The intention behind this project is not malicious; rather, it aims to inform developers of the vulnerabilities within Protectt.ai, encouraging them to enhance and improve the solution.

### Steps to Bypass

1. Download the bypass apk from releases or build it on your own.

2. Run the Kotak Neo app with the hook applied, and observe how the Protectt.ai solution is bypassed effortlessly.
